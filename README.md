# 🎵 Spotify Artist Clustering & Growth Dashboard

This project analyzes Spotify artist data to explore musical styles and growth trends. Using machine learning, it clusters artists based on audio features, enabling recommendations and visualizing genre shifts over time. It also includes an interactive Tableau dashboard for exploration.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze audio features of tracks from diverse artists
- Cluster artists by musical style using unsupervised learning
- Visualize artist growth, genre patterns, and clusters
- Recommend similar artists based on audio profile
- Combine SQL, Python, ML, and Tableau for full-stack delivery

## 📦 Tools & Technologies

- Spotify API + Spotipy (Python)
- SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- scikit-learn (for clustering)
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Tableau (for dashboards)
