# 🎵 Spotify Artist Clustering & Growth Dashboard

This end-to-end project analyzes Spotify artist data to explore musical styles, audio trends, and artist growth. It uses machine learning to cluster artists based on sound, and includes an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore genre and feature patterns. A lightweight AI component adds lyrical sentiment analysis or recommendations to enrich the story.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze audio features of tracks from diverse artists
- Visualize artist popularity, audio trends, and genre patterns
- Cluster artists by musical style using unsupervised learning
- Recommend similar artists based on audio profile
- Use NLP/AI to add sentiment or discovery insights
- Deliver a full-stack analytics & data science project using SQL, Python, ML, and Tableau

## 📦 Tools & Technologies

- Spotify API + Spotipy (Python)
- MySQL (or PostgreSQL) for structured storage
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Tableau (interactive dashboard)
- Hugging Face / TextBlob (for optional AI/NLP)
